# Purpose
This GitHub account has been set up for collaborative development of FAIRER Data Management tools.
# FAIRER
FAIRER = FAIR + Ethical + Reproducible 
FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles emphasize machine-actionability and have become a global norm across all data domains. However, data that are FAIR in all respects are not necessarily transparent although ethical and reproducible principles are also required across all domains. Legal, socio-ethical, and traceability considerations are as important as the FAIR principles in the data ecosystem. FAIR data should thus be FAIRER, including also ethical and reproducible as key components (CINECA 2023). While data in particular fields may have additional data qualities (e.g., real-time, resilient, high availability, timely, equitable, spatial, timeseries, connected, etc.), these attributes don’t necessarily apply across the board. The FAIRER acronym embodies a universally essential set of data management principles that should apply across all data domains with Ethical + Reproducible capturing the requirement for transparency.  
## Ethical 
Ethical data means that: (a) Data are collected and managed in compliance with relevant government and professional codes of conduct, values and ethics, scientific integrity and responsible conduct of research; (b) Restricted, confidential, and sensitive data are handled appropriately, for example by implementing user authentication and controlled access to the data and and/or data anonymization and de-identification; (c) A statement is made as to whether or not Indigenous considerations exist and where applicable, Indigenous data sovereignty is respected and data are managed in accordance with [CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care), [OCAP](https://fnigc.ca/ocap-training/) and [UNDRIP](https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2018/11/UNDRIP_E_web.pdf) principles; (d) Data assets are managed in a manner such that data used as input to Big Data or Artificial Intelligence applications can be confirmed to be relevant, accurate, and up-to-date, and can be tested for unintended biases; (e) Contributors and contact person information is provided; and, (f) Copyright information and licenses/data use agreements are provided. Licenses should as open as possible permitting data reuse, derivation, and re-dissemination.  
## Reproducible  
Reproducible data means that the final data are computationally reproducible, i.e. a 3rd party can verify the data lineage and processing, reanalyze the data and obtain consistent computational results using the provider’s input raw data, computational steps, methods, computer code, and conditions of analysis in order to determine if the same result emerges from the reprocessing and reanalysis (NASEM 2019). All published data needs to be reproducible. Note that reproducibility is a different concept from replicability. In the latter case, the final published data are linked to sufficiently detailed methods and information to support verification of replicability such that a 3rd party would be able to verify the results based on the independent collection of new raw data using similar or different methods but leading to comparable results (NASEM 2019).
